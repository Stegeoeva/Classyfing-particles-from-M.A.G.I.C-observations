# Classyging Particles

Data:Cherenkov gamma telescope or MAGIC ( Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere.
The dataset has 19020 instances with no missing values. It contains 10 features, which are continuous, and a binary class that indicates an instance to be gamma (signal) or hadron(background).

Machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis were employed in order to determine the most important features required to draw conclusions, make predictions and finally make suggestions.
